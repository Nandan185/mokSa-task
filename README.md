# Task Management Dashboard

## Summary

The Task Management Dashboard is a React-based application that allows users to organize and track tasks using a Kanban-style board. The project demonstrates a solid understanding of React fundamentals, including state management, component composition, and side effects. The use of TypeScript adds type safety, improving code reliability and maintainability. Tailwind CSS is effectively employed to create a clean, professional monochrome design that's both visually appealing and functional.
