# Task Management Dashboard

## Summary

The Task Management Dashboard is a React-based application that helps users organize and track their tasks using a Kanban-style board. It demonstrates a strong grasp of React fundamentals, including state management, component composition, and handling side effects. The project is built with TypeScript, ensuring type safety and enhancing code reliability and maintainability.

A key feature is the drag-and-drop interface, implemented using DND (Drag and Drop) technology, which allows users to seamlessly move tasks across different columns to update their status. This interaction provides an intuitive user experience that mirrors real-world task management workflows.

Styling is handled with Tailwind CSS, which creates a clean, professional monochrome design that is both visually appealing and functionally effective.
